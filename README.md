##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   You are allowed to use one global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are allowed to use the standard library.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar` .
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `monty.h`.

## Description
*   Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## monty byte code files

*   Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/monty


## Project Description
Pointers, arrays and strings.

* **0. monty** - implement the push and pall opcodes. - `0-monty`.
